#Project Euler problem 26 asks us to find the value of d < n for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

#One way to approach this problem is to use long division to compute the decimal expansion of 1/d and look for repeating patterns. Once we find a repeating pattern, we know that the cycle length is equal to the number of digits in the repeating pattern.

#Here, we define a function recurring_cycle_length that takes an integer d and returns the length of the recurring cycle in the decimal expansion of 1/d. We use a dictionary remainders to keep track of the remainders we get when dividing 1 by d. We repeatedly multiply the remainder by 10 and take the remainder modulo d until we get a remainder that we've seen before (in which case we've found a repeating pattern) or we get a remainder of 0 (in which case the decimal expansion terminates). We then return the length of the repeating pattern.

#In the main part of the program, we loop over all values of d from 1 to n-1 and compute the length of the recurring cycle for each d using the recurring_cycle_length function. We keep track of the longest cycle length we've seen so far and the value of d that produced that length. Finally, we print out the value of d with the longest recurring cycle.
